# Linguagem R

## Plotando dados

- [Base graphics](http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~ajrs/R/r-plot_data.html)
- [plot](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.5.3/topics/plot)
- [Producing Simple Graphs with R](https://www.harding.edu/fmccown/r/)
- [Multiple graphs on one page (ggplot2)](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)/)

## Funções

- [User-written Functions](https://www.statmethods.net/management/userfunctions.html)

## Transposição de Dados

- [Aggregation and Restructuring data (from “R in Action”)](https://www.r-statistics.com/tag/transpose/)

## Pacotes

- [vroom](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/05/vroom-1-0-0/): vroom reads rectangular data, such as comma separated (csv), tab separated (tsv) or fixed width files (fwf) into R. It performs similar roles to functions like readr::read_csv(), data.table::fread() or read.csv(). But for many datasets vroom::vroom() can read them much, much faster (hence the name).
